 *    more accurate, larger numbers make alignment faster. (millis)
 *
 * * `split_mode`: When true, `alass` will attempt alignment assuming the presence of commercial breaks
 *    or added/removed scenes. Disabling `split_mode` can make syncing faster but will only correct
 *    subtitles whose misalignment is the result of a constant shift.
 *
 * * `split_penalty`: Determines how eager the algorithm is to avoid splitting of the subtitles. A
 *    value of 1000 means that all lines will be shifted by the same offset, while 0.01 will produce
 *    MANY segments with different offsets. Values from 1 to 20 are the most reasonable.
